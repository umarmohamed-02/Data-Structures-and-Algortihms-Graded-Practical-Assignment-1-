# University Student Record and Campus Route Management System

CIT300 – Data Structures and Algorithms
Graded Practical Assignment 1 (Group Project, 10% of module grade)

## Project Overview
A Java console application that manages university student records and models
campus locations/connections as a graph. Demonstrates linked lists, stacks,
queues, a BST/AVL tree, hashing, and graph traversal (BFS/DFS).

## Group Members

| Name | Student ID | Responsibility | Individual Contribution |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| M.K.Umar Mohamed | 23DA2-0501 | Linked list – student record management | Implemented the custom singly linked list (Node, StudentLinkedList) and Student record class from scratch. Built add, update, delete, search, and display operations with input validation (duplicate ID checks, marks range, empty fields). Tested independently before integration. |
| H.F.F Hamna | 23DA2-0479 | Stack & queue implementation | Implemented ActionStack (push, pop, peek, display) for tracking recent actions and ServiceQueue (enqueue, dequeue, display) for managing student service requests in FIFO order. Both built from scratch using linked-list-based nodes. |
| MA.Aabith Nihmy | 23DA2-0538 | BST/AVL tree & hashing/search | Implemented StudentBST (Binary Search Tree) to organize and display student records sorted by Student ID using in-order traversal. Implemented StudentHashTable with separate chaining for O(1) average-case student ID lookups. Integrated both into the main menu (options 8 and 9). |
| S.A.M.Seyed Asliff Ahamed Moulana | 23DA2-0609 | Graph, campus locations/connections, BFS/DFS | Implemented the CampusGraph component using an adjacency list to represent campus locations and their connections. Built functions to add/remove locations and connections, display the campus network, and perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal. |

## Features
- Add / update / delete / search / display student records (Linked List)
- Undo / recent-actions history (Stack)
- Student service request queue (Queue)
- Student records organized/searched by ID (BST)
- Fast student ID lookup (Hashing)
- Campus locations and connections modeled as a Graph (adjacency list)
- Add/remove locations and connections; display campus network
- Graph traversal via BFS
- Menu-driven console interface with input validation

## Menu

2. Update Student Record
3. Delete Student Record
4. Display All Records (Linked List)
5. Add Service Request to Queue
6. Process Next Service Request
7. Display Recent Actions (Stack)
8. Display Students (BST/AVL)
9. Search Student (Hashing)
10. Add Campus Location
11. Remove Campus Location
12. Add Campus Connection/Road
13. Remove Campus Connection/Road
14. Display Campus Connections
15. Traverse Campus Locations (BFS)
16. Exit
